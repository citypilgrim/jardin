4.  Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour my people like bread;they refuse to call upon God. For the choirmaster. According to Mahalath. A Maskil of David.
5.  There they are, overwhelmed with dread,where there was nothing to fear.For God has scattered the bonesof those who besieged you.You put them to shame,for God has despised them.  For the choirmaster. According to Mahalath. A Maskil of David.
