1.  This is what the LORD says:  “For three transgressions of Moab, even four,I will not revoke My judgment,because he burned to limethe bones of Edom’s king.
2.  So I will send fire against Moabto consume the citadels of Kerioth.Moab will die in tumult,amid war cries and the sound of the ram’s horn.
3.  I will cut off the ruler of Moaband kill all the officials with him,”says the LORD.
4.  This is what the LORD says:  “For three transgressions of Judah, even four,I will not revoke My judgment,because they reject the Law of the LORDand fail to keep His statutes;they are led astray by the liesin which their fathers walked.
5.  So I will send fire upon Judahto consume the citadels of Jerusalem.”
6.  This is what the LORD says:  “For three transgressions of Israel, even four,I will not revoke My judgment,because they sell the righteous for silverand the needy for a pair of sandals.
7.  They trample on the heads of the pooras on the dust of the earth;they push the needy out of their way.A man and his fatherhave relations with the same girland so profane My holy name.
8.  They lie down beside every altaron garments taken in pledge.And in the house of their God,they drink wine obtained through fines.
9.  Yet it was I who destroyedthe Amorite before them,though his height was like that of the cedars,and he was as strong as the oaks.Yet I destroyed his fruit aboveand his roots below.
10. And I brought you up from the land of Egyptand led you forty years in the wilderness,that you might take possessionof the land of the Amorite.
11. I raised up prophets from your sonsand Nazirites from your young men.Is this not true,O children of Israel?”declares the LORD.
12. “But you made the Nazirites drink wineand commanded the prophets not to prophesy.
13. Behold, I am about to crush you in your placeas with a cart full of grain.
14. Escape will fail the swift,the strong will not prevail by his strength,and the mighty will not save his life.
15. The archer will not stand his ground,the fleet of foot will not escape,and the horseman will not save his life.
16. Even the bravest of mighty menwill flee naked on that day,”declares the LORD.
