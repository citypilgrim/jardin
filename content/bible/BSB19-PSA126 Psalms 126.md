1.  When the LORD restored the captives of Zion,we were like dreamers.A song of ascents.
2.  Then our mouths were filled with laughter,our tongues with shouts of joy.Then it was said among the nations,“The LORD has done great things for them.”A song of ascents.
3.  The LORD has done great things for us;we are filled with joy. A song of ascents.
4.  Restore our captives, O LORD,like streams in the Negev.A song of ascents.
5.  Those who sow in tearswill reap with shouts of joy.A song of ascents.
6.  He who goes out weeping,bearing a trail of seed,will surely return with shouts of joy,carrying sheaves of grain.
