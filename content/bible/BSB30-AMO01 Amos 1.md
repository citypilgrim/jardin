1.  These are the words of Amos, who was among the sheepherders of Tekoa—what he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, in the days when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel.
2.  He said:  “The LORD roars from Zionand raises His voice from Jerusalem;the pastures of the shepherds mourn,and the summit of Carmel withers.”
3.  This is what the LORD says:  “For three transgressions of Damascus, even four,I will not revoke My judgment,because they threshed Gileadwith sledges of iron.
4.  So I will send fire upon the house of Hazaelto consume the citadels of Ben-hadad.
5.  I will break down the gates of Damascus;I will cut off the ruler of the Valley of Avenand the one who wields the scepter in Beth-eden.The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir,”says the LORD.
6.  This is what the LORD says:  “For three transgressions of Gaza, even four,I will not revoke My judgment,because they exiled a whole population,delivering them up to Edom.
7.  So I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza,to consume its citadels.
8.  I will cut off the ruler of Ashdodand the one who wields the scepter in Ashkelon.I will turn My hand against Ekron,and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,”says the Lord GOD.
9.  This is what the LORD says:  “For three transgressions of Tyre, even four,I will not revoke My judgment,because they delivered up a whole congregation of exiles to Edomand broke a covenant of brotherhood.
10. So I will send fire upon the walls of Tyreto consume its citadels.”
11. This is what the LORD says:  “For three transgressions of Edom, even four,I will not revoke My judgment,because he pursued his brother with the swordand stifled all compassion;his anger raged continually,and his fury flamed incessantly.
12. So I will send fire upon Temanto consume the citadels of Bozrah.”
13. This is what the LORD says:  “For three transgressions of the Ammonites, even four,I will not revoke My judgment,because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gileadin order to enlarge their territory.
14. So I will kindle a fire in the walls of Rabbahto consume its citadelsamid war cries on the day of battleand a violent wind on the day of tempest.
15. Their king will go into exile—he and his princes together,”says the LORD.
