1.  Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion.It cannot be moved; it abides forever.A song of ascents.
2.  As the mountains surround Jerusalem,so the LORD surrounds His people,both now and forevermore. A song of ascents.
3.  For the scepter of the wicked will not restupon the land allotted to the righteous,so that the righteous will not put forththeir hands to injustice. A song of ascents.
4.  Do good, O LORD, to those who are good,and to the upright in heart.A song of ascents.
5.  But those who turn to crooked waysthe LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.
