1.  In the twelfth year, on the first day of the twelfth month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2.  “Son of man, take up a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him:  ‘You are like a lion among the nations;you are like a monster in the seas.You thrash about in your rivers,churning up the waters with your feetand muddying the streams.’
3.  This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will spread My net over youwith a company of many peoples,and they will draw you up in My net.
4.  I will abandon you on the landand hurl you into the open field.I will cause all the birds of the airto settle upon you,and all the beasts of the earthto eat their fill of you.
5.  I will put your flesh on the mountainsand fill the valleys with your remains.
6.  I will drench the landwith the flow of your blood,all the way to the mountains—the ravines will be filled.
7.  When I extinguish you,I will cover the heavensand darken their stars.I will cover the sun with a cloud,and the moon will not give its light.
8.  All the shining lights in the heavensI will darken over you,and I will bring darknessupon your land,’declares the Lord GOD.
9.  ‘I will trouble the hearts of many peoples,when I bring about your destruction among the nations,in countries you do not know.
10. I will cause many peoplesto be appalled over you,and their kings will shudder in horror because of youwhen I brandish My sword before them.On the day of your downfalleach of them will trembleevery moment for his life.’
11. For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘The sword of the king of Babylonwill come against you!
12. I will make your hordes fallby the swords of the mighty,the most ruthless of all nations.They will ravage the pride of Egyptand all her multitudes will be destroyed.
13. I will slaughter all her cattlebeside the abundant waters.No human foot will muddy them again,and no cattle hooves will disturb them.
14. Then I will let her waters settleand will make her rivers flow like oil,’declares the Lord GOD.
15. ‘When I make the land of Egypt a desolationand empty it of all that filled it,when I strike down all who live there,then they will know that I am the LORD.’
16. This is the lament they will chant for her; the daughters of the nations will chant it. Over Egypt and all her multitudes they will chant it, declares the Lord GOD.”
17. In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
18. “Son of man, wail for the multitudes of Egypt, and consign her and the daughters of the mighty nations to the depths of the earth with those who descend to the Pit:
19. Whom do you surpass in beauty?Go down and be placed with the uncircumcised!
20. They will fall among those slain by the sword.The sword is appointed!Let them drag her awayalong with all her multitudes.
21. Mighty chiefs will speak from the midst of Sheolabout Egypt and her allies:‘They have come down and lie with the uncircumcised,with those slain by the sword.’
22. Assyria is there with her whole company;her graves are all around her.All of them are slain,fallen by the sword.
23. Her graves are set in the depths of the Pit,and her company is all around her grave.All of them are slain,fallen by the sword—those who once spread terrorin the land of the living.
24. Elam is therewith all her multitudes around her grave.All of them are slain,fallen by the sword—those who went down uncircumcisedto the earth below,who once spread their terrorin the land of the living.They bear their disgracewith those who descend to the Pit.
25. Among the slain they preparea resting place for Elamwith all her hordes,with her graves all around her.All of them are uncircumcised,slain by the sword,although their terror was once spreadin the land of the living.They bear their disgracewith those who descend to the Pit.They are placed among the slain.
26. Meshech and Tubal are therewith all their multitudes,with their graves all around them.All of them are uncircumcised,slain by the sword,because they spread their terrorin the land of the living.
27. They do not lie downwith the fallen warriors of old,who went down to Sheolwith their weapons of war,whose swords were placed under their heads,whose shields rested on their bones,although the terror of the mightywas once in the land of the living.
28. But you too will be shatteredand lie down among the uncircumcised,with those slain by the sword.
29. Edom is there,and all her kings and princes,who despite their mightare laid among those slain by the sword.They lie down with the uncircumcised,with those who descend to the Pit.
30. All the leaders of the northand all the Sidonians are there;they went down in disgrace with the slain,despite the terror of their might.They lie uncircumcisedwith those slain by the swordand bear their shamewith those who descend to the Pit.
31. Pharaoh will see themand be comforted over all his multitude—Pharaoh and all his army,slain by the sword,declares the Lord GOD.
32. For I will spread My terrorin the land of the living,so that Pharaoh and all his multitudewill be laid to rest among the uncircumcised,with those slain by the sword,declares the Lord GOD.”
