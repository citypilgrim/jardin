1.  The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty;the LORD has clothed and armed Himself with strength.The world indeed is firmly established;it cannot be moved.
2.  Your throne was established long ago;You are from all eternity.
3.  The floodwaters have risen, O LORD;the rivers have raised their voice;the seas lift up their pounding waves.
4.  Above the roar of many waters—the mighty breakers of the sea—the LORD on high is majestic.
5.  Your testimonies are fully confirmed;holiness adorns Your house, O LORD,for all the days to come.
