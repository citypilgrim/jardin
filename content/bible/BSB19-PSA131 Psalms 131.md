1.  My heart is not proud, O LORD,my eyes are not haughty.I do not aspire to great thingsor matters too lofty for me.A song of ascents. Of David.
2.  Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul;like a weaned child with his mother,like a weaned child is my soul within me. A song of ascents. Of David.
3.  O Israel, put your hope in the LORD,both now and forevermore.
