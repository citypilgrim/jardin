1.  If the LORD had not been on our side—let Israel now declare—A song of ascents. Of David.
2.  if the LORD had not been on our sidewhen men attacked us,A song of ascents. Of David.
3.  when their anger flared against us,then they would have swallowed us alive,A song of ascents. Of David.
4.  then the floods would have engulfed us,then the torrent would have overwhelmed us,A song of ascents. Of David.
5.  then the raging waterswould have swept us away. A song of ascents. Of David.
6.  Blessed be the LORD,who has not given us as prey to their teeth.A song of ascents. Of David.
7.  We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler;the net is torn, and we have slipped away.A song of ascents. Of David.
8.  Our help is in the name of the LORD,the Maker of heaven and earth.
