1.  In the LORD I take refuge.How then can you say to me: “Flee like a bird to your mountain! For the choirmaster. Of David.
2.  For behold, the wicked bend their bows.They set their arrow on the stringto shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart. For the choirmaster. Of David.
3.  If the foundations are destroyed,what can the righteous do?”  For the choirmaster. Of David.
4.  The LORD is in His holy temple;the LORD is on His heavenly throne.His eyes are watching closely;they examine the sons of men. For the choirmaster. Of David.
5.  The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked;His soul hates the lover of violence. For the choirmaster. Of David.
6.  On the wicked He will rain down fiery coals and sulfur;a scorching wind will be their portion.  For the choirmaster. Of David.
7.  For the LORD is righteous; He loves justice.The upright will see His face.
