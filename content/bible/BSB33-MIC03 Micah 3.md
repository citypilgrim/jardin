1.  Then I said:  “Hear now, O leaders of Jacob,you rulers of the house of Israel.Should you not know justice?
2.  You hate good and love evil.You tear the skin from my peopleand strip the flesh from their bones.
3.  You eat the flesh of my peopleafter stripping off their skinand breaking their bones.You chop them up like flesh for the cooking pot,like meat in a cauldron.”
4.  Then they will cry out to the LORD,but He will not answer them.At that time He will hide His face from thembecause of the evil they have done.
5.  This is what the LORD says:  “As for the prophetswho lead My people astray,who proclaim peacewhile they chew with their teeth,but declare war against onewho puts nothing in their mouths:
6.  Therefore night will come over you without visions,and darkness without divination.The sun will set on these prophets,and the daylight will turn black over them.
7.  Then the seers will be ashamedand the diviners will be disgraced.They will all cover their mouthsbecause there is no answer from God.”
8.  As for me, however, I am filled with powerby the Spirit of the LORD,with justice and courage,to declare to Jacob his transgressionand to Israel his sin.
9.  Now hear this, O leaders of the house of Jacoband rulers of the house of Israel,who despise justiceand pervert all that is right,
10. who build Zion with bloodshedand Jerusalem with iniquity.
11. Her leaders judge for a bribe,her priests teach for a price,and her prophets practice divination for money.Yet they lean upon the LORD, saying,“Is not the LORD among us?No disaster can come upon us.”
12. Therefore, because of you,Zion will be plowed like a field,Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,and the temple mount a wooded ridge.
