1.  Many a time they have persecuted me from my youth—let Israel now declare—A song of ascents.
2.  many a time they have persecuted me from my youth,but they have not prevailed against me.A song of ascents.
3.  The plowmen plowed over my back;they made their furrows long.A song of ascents.
4.  The LORD is righteous;He has cut me from the cords of the wicked. A song of ascents.
5.  May all who hate Zionbe turned back in shame.A song of ascents.
6.  May they be like grass on the rooftops,which withers before it can grow,A song of ascents.
7.  unable to fill the hands of the reaper,or the arms of the binder of sheaves.A song of ascents.
8.  May none who pass by say to them,“The blessing of the LORD be on you;we bless you in the name of the LORD.”
