1.  I will stand at my guard postand station myself on the ramparts.I will watch to see what He will say to me,and how I should answer when corrected.
2.  Then the LORD answered me:  “Write down this visionand clearly inscribe it on tablets,so that a herald may run with it.
3.  For the vision awaits an appointed time;it testifies of the end and does not lie.Though it lingers, wait for it,since it will surely come and will not delay.
4.  Look at the proud one; his soul is not upright—but the righteous will live by faith—
5.  and wealth indeed betrays him.He is an arrogant man never at rest.He enlarges his appetite like Sheol,and like Death, he is never satisfied.He gathers all the nations to himselfand collects all the peoples as his own.
6.  Will not all of these take up a taunt against him,speaking with mockery and derision: ‘Woe to him who amasses what is not hisand makes himself rich with many loans!How long will this go on?’
7.  Will not your creditors suddenly ariseand those who disturb you awaken?Then you will become their prey.
8.  Because you have plundered many nations,the remnant of the people will plunder you—because of your bloodshed against manand your violence against the land, the city,and all their dwellers.
9.  Woe to him who builds his houseby unjust gain,to place his nest on highand escape the hand of disaster!
10. You have plotted shame for your houseby cutting off many peoplesand forfeiting your life.
11. For the stones will cry out from the wall,and the rafters will echo it from the woodwork.
12. Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshedand establishes a town by iniquity!
13. Is it not indeed from the LORD of Hoststhat the labor of the people only feeds the fire,and the nations weary themselves in vain?
14. For the earth will be filledwith the knowledge of the glory of the LORDas the waters cover the sea.
15. Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors,pouring it from the wineskin until they are drunk,in order to gaze at their nakedness!
16. You will be filled with shame instead of glory.You too must drinkand expose your uncircumcision!The cup in the LORD’s right handwill come around to you,and utter disgrace will cover your glory.
17. For your violence against Lebanon will overwhelm you,and the destruction of animals will terrify you,because of your bloodshed against menand your violence against the land, the city,and all their dwellers.
18. What use is an idol,that a craftsman should carve it—or an image,a teacher of lies?For its maker trusts in his own creation;he makes idols that cannot speak.
19. Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Awake!’or to silent stone, ‘Arise!’Can it give guidance?Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver,yet there is no breath in it at all.”
20. But the LORD is in His holy temple;let all the earth be silent before Him.
