1.  Behold, how good and pleasant it iswhen brothers live together in harmony! A song of ascents. Of David.
2.  It is like fine oil on the head,running down on the beard,running down Aaron’s beardover the collar of his robes. A song of ascents. Of David.
3.  It is like the dew of Hermonfalling on the mountains of Zion.For there the LORD has bestowed the blessingof life forevermore.
