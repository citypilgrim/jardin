1.  Blessed are all who fear the LORD,who walk in His ways! A song of ascents.
2.  For when you eat the fruit of your labor,blessings and prosperity will be yours. A song of ascents.
3.  Your wife will be like a fruitful vineflourishing within your house,your sons like olive shootssitting around your table. A song of ascents.
