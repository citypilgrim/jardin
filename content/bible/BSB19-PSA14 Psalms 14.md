1.  The fool says in his heart,“There is no God.” They are corrupt; their acts are vile.There is no one who does good.  For the choirmaster. Of David.
2.  The LORD looks down from heavenupon the sons of mento see if any understand,if any seek God. For the choirmaster. Of David.
3.  All have turned away,they have together become corrupt;there is no one who does good,not even one.  For the choirmaster. Of David.
4.  Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour my people like bread;they refuse to call upon the LORD. For the choirmaster. Of David.
5.  There they are, overwhelmed with dread,for God is in the company of the righteous. For the choirmaster. Of David.
6.  You sinners frustrate the plans of the oppressed,yet the LORD is their shelter.  For the choirmaster. Of David.
7.  Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people,let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad!
