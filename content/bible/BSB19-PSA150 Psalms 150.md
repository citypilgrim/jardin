1.  Hallelujah! Praise God in His sanctuary.Praise Him in His mighty heavens.
2.  Praise Him for His mighty acts;praise Him for His excellent greatness.
3.  Praise Him with the sound of the horn;praise Him with the harp and lyre.
4.  Praise Him with tambourine and dancing;praise Him with strings and flute.
5.  Praise Him with clashing cymbals;praise Him with resounding cymbals.
6.  Let everything that has breath praise the LORD! Hallelujah!
