1.  The LORD is my shepherd;I shall not want. A Psalm of David.
2.  He makes me lie down in green pastures;He leads me beside quiet waters. A Psalm of David.
3.  He restores my soul;He guides me in the paths of righteousnessfor the sake of His name. A Psalm of David.
4.  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,I will fear no evil,for You are with me;Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.  A Psalm of David.
5.  You prepare a table before mein the presence of my enemies.You anoint my head with oil;my cup overflows. A Psalm of David.
6.  Surely goodness and mercy will follow meall the days of my life,and I will dwell in the house of the LORDforever.
