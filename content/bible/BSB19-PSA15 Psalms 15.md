1.  O LORD, who may abide in Your tent?Who may dwell on Your holy mountain? A Psalm of David.
2.  He who walks with integrityand practices righteousness,who speaks the truth from his heart,A Psalm of David.
3.  who has no slander on his tongue,who does no harm to his neighbor,who casts no scorn on his friend,A Psalm of David.
4.  who despises the vilebut honors those who fear the LORD,who does not revise a costly oath,A Psalm of David.
5.  who lends his money without interestand refuses a bribe against the innocent. He who does these thingswill never be shaken.
