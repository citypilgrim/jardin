1.  Unless the LORD builds the house,its builders labor in vain;unless the LORD protects the city,its watchmen stand guard in vain.A song of ascents. Of Solomon.
2.  In vain you rise earlyand stay up late,toiling for bread to eat—for He gives sleep to His beloved. A song of ascents. Of Solomon.
3.  Children are indeed a heritage from the LORD,and the fruit of the womb is His reward.A song of ascents. Of Solomon.
4.  Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,so are children born in one’s youth.A song of ascents. Of Solomon.
5.  Blessed is the manwhose quiver is full of them.He will not be put to shamewhen he confronts the enemies at the gate.
