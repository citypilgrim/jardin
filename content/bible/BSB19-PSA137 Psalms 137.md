1.  By the rivers of Babylon we sat and weptwhen we remembered Zion.
2.  There on the willowswe hung our harps,
3.  for there our captors requested a song;our tormentors demanded songs of joy: “Sing us a song of Zion.”
4.  How can we sing a song of the LORDin a foreign land?
5.  If I forget you, O Jerusalem,may my right hand cease to function.
6.  May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouthif I do not remember you,if I do not exalt Jerusalemas my greatest joy!
7.  Remember, O LORD,the sons of Edom on the day Jerusalem fell:“Destroy it,” they said,“tear it down to its foundations!”
8.  O Daughter of Babylon,doomed to destruction,blessed is he who repays youas you have done to us.
9.  Blessed is he who seizes your infantsand dashes them against the rocks.
