1.  I cry aloud to the LORD;I lift my voice to the LORD for mercy. A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer.
2.  I pour out my complaint before Him;I reveal my trouble to Him.  A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer.
3.  Although my spirit grows faint within me,You know my way.Along the path I travelthey have hidden a snare for me. A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer.
4.  Look to my right and see;no one attends to me.There is no refuge for me;no one cares for my soul.  A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer.
5.  I cry to You, O LORD: “You are my refuge,my portion in the land of the living.”  A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer.
6.  Listen to my cry,for I am brought quite low.Rescue me from my pursuers,for they are too strong for me. A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer.
7.  Free my soul from prison,that I may praise Your name.The righteous will gather around mebecause of Your goodness to me.
