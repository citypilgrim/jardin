1.  Woe to those at ease in Zionand those secure on Mount Samaria,the distinguished ones of the foremost nation,to whom the house of Israel comes.
2.  Cross over to Calneh and see;go from there to the great Hamath;then go down to Gath of the Philistines.Are you better than these kingdoms?Is their territory larger than yours?
3.  You dismiss the day of calamityand bring near a reign of violence.
4.  You lie on beds inlaid with ivory,and lounge upon your couches.You dine on lambs from the flockand calves from the stall.
5.  You improvise songs on the harp like Davidand invent your own musical instruments.
6.  You drink wine by the bowlfuland anoint yourselves with the finest oils,but you fail to grieveover the ruin of Joseph.
7.  Therefore, you will now go into exileas the first of the captives,and your feasting and loungingwill come to an end.
8.  The Lord GOD has sworn by Himself—the LORD, the God of Hosts, has declared:  “I abhor Jacob’s prideand detest his citadels,so I will deliver up the cityand everything in it.”
9.  And if there are ten men left in one house, they too will die.
10. And when the relative who is to burn the bodies picks them up to remove them from the house, he will call to one inside, “Is anyone else with you?”  “None,” that person will answer.  “Silence,” the relative will retort, “for the name of the LORD must not be invoked.”
11. For the LORD gives a command:  “The great house will be smashed to pieces,and the small house to rubble.”
12. “Do horses gallop on the cliffs?Does one plow the sea with oxen?But you have turned justice into poisonand the fruit of righteousness into wormwood—
13. you who rejoice in Lo-debar and say,‘Did we not take Karnaim by our own strength?’
14. For behold, I will raise up a nationagainst you, O house of Israel,”declares the LORD, the God of Hosts,“and they will oppress youfrom Lebo-hamath to the Brook of the Arabah.”
