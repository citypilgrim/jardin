1.  He who dwells in the shelter of the Most Highwill abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
2.  I will say to the LORD, “You are my refuge and my fortress,my God, in whom I trust.”
3.  Surely He will deliver youfrom the snare of the fowler,and from the deadly plague.
4.  He will cover you with His feathers;under His wings you will find refuge;His faithfulness is a shield and rampart.
5.  You will not fear the terror of the night,nor the arrow that flies by day,
6.  nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,nor the calamity that destroys at noon.
7.  Though a thousand may fall at your side,and ten thousand at your right hand,no harm will come near you.
8.  You will only see it with your eyesand witness the punishment of the wicked.
9.  Because you have made the LORD your dwelling—my refuge, the Most High—
10. no evil will befall you,no plague will approach your tent.
11. For He will command His angels concerning youto guard you in all your ways.
12. They will lift you up in their hands,so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
13. You will tread on the lion and cobra;you will trample the young lion and serpent.
14. “Because he loves Me, I will deliver him;because he knows My name, I will protect him.
15. When he calls out to Me,I will answer him;I will be with him in trouble.I will deliver him and honor him.
16. With long life I will satisfy himand show him My salvation.”
