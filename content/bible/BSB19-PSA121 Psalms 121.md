1.  I lift up my eyes to the hills.From where does my help come?A song of ascents.
2.  My help comes from the LORD,the Maker of heaven and earth. A song of ascents.
3.  He will not allow your foot to slip;your Protector will not slumber.A song of ascents.
4.  Behold, the Protector of Israelwill neither slumber nor sleep. A song of ascents.
5.  The LORD is your keeper;the LORD is the shade on your right hand.A song of ascents.
6.  The sun will not strike you by day,nor the moon by night. A song of ascents.
7.  The LORD will guard you from all evil;He will preserve your soul.A song of ascents.
8.  The LORD will watch over your coming and going,both now and forevermore.
