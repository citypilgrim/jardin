1.  Make haste, O God, to deliver me!Hurry, O LORD, to help me!  For the choirmaster. Of David. To bring remembrance.
2.  May those who seek my lifebe ashamed and confounded;may those who wish me harmbe repelled and humiliated. For the choirmaster. Of David. To bring remembrance.
3.  May those who say, “Aha, aha!”retreat because of their shame.  For the choirmaster. Of David. To bring remembrance.
4.  May all who seek Yourejoice and be glad in You;may those who love Your salvation always say,“Let God be magnified!” For the choirmaster. Of David. To bring remembrance.
5.  But I am poor and needy;hurry to me, O God.You are my help and my deliverer;O LORD, do not delay.
