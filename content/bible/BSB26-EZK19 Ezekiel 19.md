1.  “As for you, take up a lament for the princes of Israel
2.  and say:  ‘What was your mother?A lioness among the lions!She lay down among the young lions;she reared her cubs.
3.  She brought up one of her cubs,and he became a young lion.After learning to tear his prey,he devoured men.
4.  When the nations heard of him,he was trapped in their pit.With hooks they led him awayto the land of Egypt.
5.  When she saw that she had waited in vain,that her hope was lost,she took another of her cubsand made him a young lion.
6.  He prowled among the lions,and became a young lion.After learning to tear his prey,he devoured men.
7.  He broke down their strongholdsand devastated their cities.The land and everything in itshuddered at the sound of his roaring.
8.  Then the nations set out against himfrom the provinces on every side.They spread their net over him;he was trapped in their pit.
9.  With hooks they caged himand brought him to the king of Babylon.They brought him into captivityso that his roar was heard no longeron the mountains of Israel.
10. Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,planted by the water;it was fruitful and full of branchesbecause of the abundant waters.
11. It had strong branches, fit for a ruler’s scepter.It towered high above the thick branches,conspicuous for its heightand for its dense foliage.
12. But it was uprooted in fury,cast down to the ground,and the east wind dried up its fruit.Its strong branches were stripped offand they withered;the fire consumed them.
13. Now it is planted in the wilderness,in a dry and thirsty land.
14. Fire has gone out from its main branchand devoured its fruit;on it no strong branch remainsfit for a ruler’s scepter.’ This is a lament and shall be used as a lament.”
