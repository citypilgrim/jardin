1.  In my distress I cried to the LORD,and He answered me.A song of ascents.
2.  Deliver my soul, O LORD,from lying lips and a deceitful tongue. A song of ascents.
3.  What will He do to you,and what will be added to you,O deceitful tongue?A song of ascents.
4.  Sharp arrows will come from the warrior,with burning coals of the broom tree! A song of ascents.
5.  Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech,that I live among the tents of Kedar!A song of ascents.
6.  Too long have I dweltamong those who hate peace.A song of ascents.
7.  I am in favor of peace;but when I speak, they want war.
