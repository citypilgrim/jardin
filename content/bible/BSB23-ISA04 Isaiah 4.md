1.  In that day seven womenwill take hold of one man and say,“We will eat our own breadand provide our own clothes.Just let us be called by your name.Take away our disgrace!”
2.  On that day the Branch of the LORDwill be beautiful and glorious,and the fruit of the landwill be the pride and glory of Israel’s survivors.
3.  Whoever remains in Zionand whoever is left in Jerusalemwill be called holy—all in Jerusalem who are recorded among the living—
4.  when the Lord has washed awaythe filth of the daughters of Zionand cleansed the bloodstains from the heart of Jerusalemby a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.
5.  Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zionand over her assembliesa cloud of smoke by dayand a glowing flame of fire by night.For over all the glorythere will be a canopy,
6.  a shelter to give shadefrom the heat by day,and a refuge and hiding placefrom the storm and the rain.
