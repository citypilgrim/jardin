1.  I call upon You, O LORD; come quickly to me.Hear my voice when I call to You. A Psalm of David.
2.  May my prayer be set before You like incense,my uplifted hands like the evening offering.  A Psalm of David.
3.  Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth;keep watch at the door of my lips. A Psalm of David.
4.  Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thingor take part in works of wickednesswith men who do iniquity;let me not feast on their delicacies.  A Psalm of David.
5.  Let the righteous man strike me;let his rebuke be an act of loving devotion.It is oil for my head; let me not refuse it.For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked. A Psalm of David.
6.  When their rulers are thrown down from the cliffs,the people will listen to my words,for they are pleasant. A Psalm of David.
7.  As when one plows and breaks up the soil,so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.  A Psalm of David.
