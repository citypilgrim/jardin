1.  I lift up my eyes to You,the One enthroned in heaven.A song of ascents.
2.  As the eyes of servantslook to the hand of their master,as the eyes of a maidservantlook to the hand of her mistress,so our eyes are on the LORD our Goduntil He shows us mercy. A song of ascents.
3.  Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy,for we have endured much contempt.A song of ascents.
4.  We have endured much scorn from the arrogant,much contempt from the proud.
